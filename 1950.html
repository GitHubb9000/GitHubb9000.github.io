<h1>The 1950s </h1>

<h3> The 1950s saw some exciting technological innovations, most of which are still used today. We could have been still using computers 
    with vacuum tubes today if it weren't for the 1950s!
</h3>

<h2> Transistors in computers</h2>
   
<p> 
    A computer stores data using a system called " Binary". It involves a system of ones and zeros, which can represent a
     <strong> bit</strong> of data. It can be, for example, yes or no. You can write a letter using binary using a standardized binary chart.
     Which defines that, for example, "A" in binary is " 1010" in binary. The system works like the base ten system that humans use today, except 
     after 0, it is 1, and after 1, the one gets moved to the next number place, and it a zero replaces that number place."

     Computers used to use vacuum tubes that stored data inside a glass tube that could change the direction of electrons and therefore 
     the direction represented ones and zeros. However, with the invention of transistors by Richard Grimsdale and Douglas Webb in 1953, computers became way more reliable, and faster,
     which still becoming smaller. They work like this: a transistor is placed inside a computer. Then, it can be either charged, or uncharged
     with an extremely small electric charge. This is what paved the way for inventions like laptops and mobile smartphones.

<h2> The commercialization of nuclear power</h2>

<p> Although nuclear technology had been experimented with before the 1950s, it was only during the 1950s that a nuclear plant 
    had been successfully operational and used commercially. In June 1954, the AM-1 nuclear power generator, created by the The Institute
     of Physics and Power Engineering (FEI) began operation in Obninsk, Soviet Union.

    This marked a new milestone in clean energy. Energy created by nuclear means do no release any emissions, unlike fossil fuel energy. However, it isn't renewable.
    There is only a finite amount of nuclear material available in the world. Also, the byproduct of nuclear power production is nuclear waste, which remains 
    radioactive to a level that causes health problems for hundreds of years and remains weakly radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. However, because the energy 
    is so dense, for the amount of energy that it produces, it produces a very small amount of waste comparatively. Nuclear energy is argued to be better than fossil fuels
    in that nuclear energy is very efficient.

The creation of Nuclear energy remains arguably one of the most important moments in the history of energy.

<h2> Sputnik 1</h2>
<p> One of the major events that started in the 1950s was the Space Race, which started with the launch of Sputnik 1. The Soviet made satellite was the first 
    artificial object to enter space. Sputnik 1 had many scientific responsibilities as well: They included:
    <br>
    Providing information on the density of the atmosphere
    <br>
    Testing radio and optical methods of tracking its orbit
    <br> 
    Discovering the impact of the atmosphere on radio waves
    <br>
    And checking pressurization principles.
<br>
<br>
The creation of Sputnik 1 marked one of the first, and one of the important milestones in the history of space technology.

<h2> The digital camera</h2>
<p> In 1957, Russell Kirsch took the first digital photograph at the National Bureau of Standards (United States). It was a photograph of his three-month-old son Walden.
    The camera used was a camera that utilized a rotating drum scanner and had a meager resolution of 176x176 pixels. In comparison, today the world record for the 
    highest resolution photograph is a photograph of a piece of art taken by the Rijksmuseum in Netherlands. The final image has a resolution of 
    717 Gigapixels, or 717,000,000,000 pixels (Although it was stitched together from many photographs using the aid of A.I). Although as low-quality as Kirsch's 
photograph was, it paved the way for the future of photography.</p>
