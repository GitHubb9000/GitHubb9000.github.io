<h1> The 1990s</h1>

<h2> Dolly the sheep</h2>

<p> On the 5th of July, 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, but she wasn't just any sheep. She was the first sheep to be cloned
    entirely using an adult cell. While this wasn't the first animal to be successfully cloned, she was the first sheep to be cloned 
    using an adult cell, unlike the ever cloned animal, which also was a sheep, that used an embryo cell. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This was an amazing breakthrough after many years of hard work and research. Dolly was announced to the media on the 
    22nd of February, 1997 an recieved a huge amount of attention. She was a star. 
    <br>
    <br>
    She then lived a relatively normal life, aside form the occasional media appearence. She gave birth to 6 lambs with Welsh Mountain ram
    David. She was discovered to suffer from Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) late 2000, right after she gave birth to her last lamb.
    However, it was discovered several other sheep where she lived also contracted this disease at the same time, so it was not believed 
    it was contracted due to her special body. In 2001, she was diagnosed with arthitis and was treated. In 2003, she was diagnosed 
    with a tumor in her lungs, and she was put to sleep on the 14th of Februrary, 2003 at the age of 6.

<h2> The invention of the world wide web</h2>
<p>  The world wide web, or the internet, is a technology that
    we all know and use. It was developed by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at 
CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). He was inventing a way for scientists to widely 
share information using a computer. He created the HTTP (Hypertext transfer protocol) system. HTTP used a "server" which stored the data 
and could be accessed through a "browser". This was originally designed so scientists could share information, but soon they realised
that it was an idea with much more potential. 
<br>
<br>
This technology made the internet a much more user-friendly place and made the internet something that normal people could access and 
instead of a institution-exlusive system. We still use HTTPS ( HTTP, but more secure) today as the main system of accessing
websites on the internet.

<h2> The Mars Pathfinder</h2>
<p>  It was 1992, and NASA was starting a new mission called the "Mars Pathfinder" Mission. The idea was to send a robotic rover to the surface
    of Mars so that it can collect samples and data about the planet and relay it back to earth for scientific research. However, there was one problem.
    No one knew how to land a rover on mars. The thing was, the atmosphere of Mars is too thin for a parachute to slow
    down a rover package and land it safely on the surface. 
    <br>
    <br>
    After endless trials and failures, they designed a system. The parachute would deploy when they enter the atmosphere, when the package is 
    travelling at more than 27 thousand kilometers per hour and slow it down, but not enough for a safe landing. Then, rocket boosters will 
    slow the package down to almost a stand-still about 8 metres above the ground. Then, the package will release and bubble packaging, made
    out of extremely tough material will bounce over rocks and other sharp objects until it stops. Then, the packaging will open, and let the 
    rover out.
    <br>
    <br>
    This was no small feat. Landing an extremely complicated piece of machinery on another planet that no human has ever been to, and 
    withstanding many tough obstacles is something that takes a lot of work.
