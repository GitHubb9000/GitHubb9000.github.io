<h1> The 2000s</h1>

<h2> Google AdWords</h2>
<p> The online advertisement industry before Google announced AdWords in 2000 (now known as Google Ads) is now almost completely unrecognisable.
    Before AdWords, advertisers would pay the platform a fee to have their ad shown for a period. 
    When AdWords came, it mostly took the risk out of online advertising. AdWords worked on a 
    system of buying performance ( clicks-throughs) instead. This made Google AdWords 
    a massive success. In 2022, Google's ad revenue as worth 291.811 billion AUD.

<h2> The iPod</h2>
<p> When Steve Jobs announced the iPod on the 2rd of October, 2001, the crowd went wild. The iPod was not the first MP3 player. 
    However, it released with a then-massive capacity of 1000 songs at then-impressive CD quality. Also, it had apple's well-known ease-of-use and
    and compatibility with other apple devices such as the popular Mac. It also featured a then-high-resolution display and a easy-to-use 
    scroll-wheel.
    <br>
    <br>
    The iPod was a truly revolutionary device and it laid the foundation for other devices that we now consider
    essentials, such as the iPhone, iPad, and "smart" devices in general.

<h2> Facebook</h2>
<p> Facebook is a Social Media platform that we all know. As the most popular social media site in the world, it has 2.96 billion users.
Facebook was initially created by Harvard student Mark Zuckerburg as The Facebook. He was inspired by the idea of a campus-wide social network. He was
gifted at coding, and created the website by just himself and a couple of roommates. Within 24 hours, an approximate of 1,200-1,500 
of his fellow Harvard students had signed up. 
<br>
<br>
Today, Facebook is still the largest social media platform in the world.
</p>

<h2> YouTube</h2>
<p> 2005 saw the introduction of YouTube. It was initially created as a video-dating website by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. However,
    it did not take off. They even tried paying women $20 upload a video to YouTube. Realising that this idea was not going to work, they decide to let users
    upload any video want. This soon took off like a rocket and YouTube became very popular.
    <br>
    <br>
    Today, YouTube is "The" video site. YouTube is undeniably the most popular video-sharing platform with 2.6 billion
    users logging in at least once a month, and more when you consider the users that use YouTube without an account. 
    YouTube is the second-most popular social media site, only topped by Facebook.
</p>

<h2> The iPhone</h2>
<p> You can't talk about the 2000s without talking about the iPhone. Created by Apple in 2007, it combined PC/internet, music, and cell phone capabilities to create an
    ultimate all-in-one machine was a totally genius idea. It was made exponentially better with the introduction of the App Store a year later. 
    It completely revolutionised the world as we then knew it. Today, smartphones are considered as almost
    a necessity.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Apple's iPhones are still very popular today, and they are the most popular smartphone manufacturer in the world.
