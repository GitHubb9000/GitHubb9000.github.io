<h1> 1920-1939 </h1>
<h2> The 1920 was know as " The Roaring Twenties"  and was arguably one of the most
    rapidly changing times, and saw the invention of technologies that we now find
    difficult to live without.
</h2>

<p> There have been many inventions that happened in the '20s, but here are a 
    few that are particularly important.

<h3> The popularization of electricity</h3>

<p> The popularization and starting of the widespread use of electricity is an innovation
    that must be acknowledged as one of the most important events in history. 
    It led to the creation of mnay popular, useful, and some cases even life-changing appliances. 
    A few examples include:
    <br> 
    - The lightbulb
    - The refridgerator
    - The television

    

    The lightbulb was a truly game-changing invention, and it opened up new pathways for both play, and work. 
    They let people free to do anything they wanted at any time of the day, even when it was pitch-black at night without worrying about
    lighting, or carrying a candle. They had ample light at the flick of a switch. This was also extremely useful for 
    workplaces and the military who might need to do work at nighttime. People could now open night-time theme parks which have flashy lights and attractions. 
    By the end of the 1920s, the majority of U.S homes had electricity, 

    The refridgerator, or fridge, was also one of the most important innovations of all time. It allowed people to store all sorts of 
    food anywhere, anytime [ as long as they had an power connection] without 
    the risk of spoilage. This not only improved quality-of life, but also increased food supply.

    A television is a staple in any modern household. It provides a source of entertainment, a source of information, and a place for people to sit together and 
    enjoy time together. The television was created in 1925 by John Logie Baird.
     However, it wasn't until 1928 that the public boradcast was made. It then became a highly desired item thta could only be bought by the wealthy,
     and dreamt about by everyone else. As said by Johnny Carson, the host of The Tonight Show and four-time Emmy award recepient, 
     " If it weren't for John Logie Baird and Philo T. Farnsworth ( Best known for creating the first " Television Camera"), we'd still be eating radio dinners."

    The creation of the automobile was revolutionary in the way people travelled. It gave people a sense of freedom, and autonomy. 
    People had the freedom to leave their homes and visit family that lives far away, to go on a holiday, to for simply a day outing.  
    However, it wasn't until Henry Ford and his super-effecient assembly line came that they really began to take off.  By mid-decade 
    the U.S government was spending more that 1 billion dollar on road infastructure. By the end of the decade, there were more than 15 million
    Ford Model Ts alone on the road.
