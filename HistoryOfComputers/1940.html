<h1> The 1940s</h1>

<h2> The 1940s was a time of exciting innovtions and discoveries.  The great depression had ended 
    in 1939, leaving people a fresh decade to work on. Here are a inventions that 
were invented in the 1940s.</h2>

<h3> The creation of the microwave oven</h3>

<p> The microwave oven is no doubt one of the most useful gadgets in our kitchen. It is safe, fast, and 
    convenient to heat up almost any food. But it's creation was most certainly a 
    very interesting one.
</p>
<br>

<p> Percy Spencer, an american engineer working at Raytheon stood in front of his 
    magnetron ( a device that creates or amplifies microwaves, intially used for radars)
    with a candy bar in his pocket. After a while, he realises that the candy bar has melted.
    He then has a hunch that the microwaves from the magnetron are what caused the candy bar to 
    melt. He then tests his hunch by placing a plate of unpopped corn in front of the magnetron.
    After a while, it pops! Eureka!
</p>
<br> 
<p> When the microwaves hit water molecules inside a piece of food, the water molecules are
    agitated and start moving around. They starting bumping into each other, causing friction,
    and therefore, heat. Furthermore, because plate and other container do not contain
    water molecules, microwaves do not run the risk of heating up containers
    and causing damage.
</p>
<br>

<p> It took until the 1950s for the first commercial microwave oven came out, but there is no denying
    that this is truly one of the most useful innovations of all time.
