<h1>The 1950s </h1>

<h2> The 1950s saw some exciting technological innovations, most of which are still used today. We could have been still using computers 
    with vacuum tubes today if it weren't for the 1950s!

<h3> Transistors in computers</h3>
   
<p> 
    A computer stores data using a system called " Binary". It involves a system of ones and zeros, which can represent a
     <strong> bit</strong> of data. It can be, for example, yes or no. You can write a letter using binary using a standardized binary chart.
     Which defines that, for example, "A" in binary is " 1010" in binary. The system works like the base ten system that humans use today, except 
     after 0, it is 1, and after 1, the one gets moved to the next number place, and it a zero replaces that number place."

     Computers used to use vacuum tubes that stored data inside a glass tube that could change the direction of electrons and therefore 
     the direction represented ones and zeros. However, with the invention of transistors by Richard Grimsdale and Douglas Webb in 1953, computers became way more reliable, and faster,
     which still becoming smaller. They work like this: a transistor is placed inside a computer. Then, it can be either charged, or uncharged
     with an extremely small electric charge. This is what paved the way for inventions like laptops and mobile smartphones.

<h3> The commercialization of nuclear power</h3>

<p> Although nuclear technology had been experimented with before the 1950s, it was only during the 1950s that a nuclear plant 
    had been successfully operational and used commercially.
