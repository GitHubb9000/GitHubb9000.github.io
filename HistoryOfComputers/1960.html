<h1> The 1960s</h1>

<h3> Audio cassette tapes </h3> 

<p> Audio cassette tapes were revolutionary for the entertainment industry.
     It offered an easy way to store and listen to music whenever you like. 
    They were also much easier to use, more compact than the old reel-to-reel
     tape recorder standard that existed before the invention of the casette tape. 
     They only grew in popularity with the invention of portable music player like the Sony Walkman. 
<br>
<br>
Casette tapes were invented by Dutch engineer Lou Ottens, who worked for Phillips. He was frustrated because we was trying to 
play a piece of music using a reel-to-reel tape and failing. He then decided he needed to find a smaller, cheaper, and easier way to 
store and play music.  The casette tape was the result. In 1963, the Phillips Compact Casette was revealed at a Berlin radio exhibition.
<br>
<br>
The audio casette tape stored music using a small magnetic tape inside the casette. When the tape is placed inside 
a casette player, it passes through a magnetic read/write head and the data on the tape is read by the player.
When data is written onto the tape, it is done through magnetic particles. The particles are magnetized through
the head and aligned into patterns that represent the audio signal.  
<br>
<br>
The casette tape truly shaped the world and the way people consumed music. 
It shaped an entire era of music listening, and people still use casette tapes today, although in a limited
capacity.

<h3> The Automatic Teller Machine (ATM)</h3>
<p> The Automatic Teller Machine, or ATM is a device we all know and have used. It offers an easy way 
     to withdraw and their money, at many time, where there is an ATM. 
<br>
<br>
Although there have been other models of the ATM that have used a pin to automatically dispense 
cash, such as the one created by James Goodfellow, 
John Sheppard-Baron is generally credited with the creation of the modern ATM.
<br>
The British bank Barclays was the first to install the modern ATM. In 1967. It was
very convenient for customers, because it was much faster than waiting in a queue at a bank,
and it was better for the bank, because they didn't need employees to work withdrawing cash 
for customers, and therefore they saved on costs. 
<br>
<br>
The ATM has revolutionised the way we manage our money, and made our lives so much easier. 
ATMs are still widely in use today, although have seen a decline in usage in the recent years
due to a general lack in the usage of cash, due the rise of credits card, and futhermore
NFT tap-and-pay systems in our smartphones and smartwatches.

<h3> The computer mouse </h3>

<p> The mouse is an assumed part of a computer. However, it is surprising to think that there 
     were a time when computers without mice existed. 
     <br>
     <br>
     The computer mouse was invented in 1964 by Dougalas Engelbart with the assistance of 
     Bill English. The original design included 2 separate wheels to track movement across a 
     surface, although it has now been replaced with an optical sensor. In 1968, the first 
     public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer was shown. Over time, it has evolved 
     to include wireless connectivity. 
     <br>
     The mouse radically changed the way we interact with humans. All computers today still 
     make use of a mouse of some sort, although on laptops they have been replaced with a trackpad.
