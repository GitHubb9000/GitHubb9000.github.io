<h3> Audio cassette tapes </h3> 

<p> Audio cassette tapes were revolutionary for the entertainment industry.
     It offered an easy way to store and listen to music whenever you like. 
    They were also much easier to use, more compact than the old reel-to-reel
     tape recorder standard that existed before the invention of the casette tape. 
     They only grew in popularity with the invention of portable music player like the Sony Walkman.

Casette tapes were invented by Dutch engineer Lou Ottens, who worked for Phillips. He was frustated because we was trying to 
play a piece of music using a reel-to-reel tape and failing. He then decided he needed to find a smaller, cheaper, and easier way to 
store and play music.  The casette tape was the result. In 1963, the Phillips Compact Casette was revealed at a Berlin radio exhibition.

The audio casette tape stored music using a small magnetic tape inside the casette. When the tape is placed inside 
a casette player, it passes through a magnetic read/write head and the data on the tape is read by the player.
When data is written onto the tape, it is done through magnetic particles. The particles are magnetized through
the head and aligned into patterns that represent the audio signal.

The casette tape truly shaped the world and the way people consumed music. 
It shaped an entire era of music listening, and people still use casette tapes today, although in a limited
capacity.
