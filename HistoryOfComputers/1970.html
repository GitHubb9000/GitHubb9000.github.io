<h3> The Mobile Phone</h3>
<p> The first mobile phone, not to be confused with the first smartphone, was a device that let users
    make calls without being tethered to a wire. The first mobile phone was created my Motorola
    researcher Martin Cooper on the 3rd of April, 1973. The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X was a the first 
    phone that make and recieve calls anywhere, without a charger. The phone had a 30 minute
    talk time and took 10 hours to recharge. It also cost an eye-watering $3995, the equivalent 
    of roughly $10,000 in today's money. It wasn't the most usable phone, and was mostly only used
    by wealthy individuals, mostly government officials and business executives who needed to be reachable
    even while on the go.

    It may not have been an instant success, but the technology behind the mobile phone was a fascinating
    one and the technology is still very popular today, with 91% of people worldwide owning 
    some sort of mobile phone.

<h3> The first micro-proccessor</h3>
<p> Although proccessors had been around by now, the Intel 4004 was the first micro-proccessor. 
    The micro size of the proccesor allowed it to be fitted into electronics that used to use 
    full-size proccessors and make them portable.

    The Intel 4004 was created by a group of engineers at Intel, 
    that included Federico Faggin, Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima, and Stanley Mazor. The chip ran at 
    a clock speed of 740hz and could proccess up to process up to 92,600 instructions per second.
    It was designed to be used in the Busicom 141-PF calculator. It was also used in ATMs, cash 
    registers, and early personal computers. It was then succeded by the Intel 8008, 8080, and the 
    8086, all improving on performance and energy consumption.

    This technology totally changed the technology landscape and paved the way for future technologies like
    the iPod, and the iPhone.
