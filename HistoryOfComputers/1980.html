<h1> The 1980s </h1>

<h3> The 1980s saw some interesting development in technology,
particularly in the medical technology department.</h3>

<h2> The invention of the nicotine patch </h2>

<p> The nicotine patch was invented by scientist Frank Etscorn in the 1980s. He grew up surrounded by tobbaco, and his wife was a heavy
    smoker. He himself was not a smoker, but he was aware of the health impacts nicotine had, and was frustated by his wife's chain

is what's harmful to your body, and that is what causes improper function to your lungs and 
causes heart attacks.

One day, he was working in his lab, researching about nausea, when he accidentally split some liquid nicotine on
himself. Within minutes, he was like nauseus and like light head or something like i dont know man ill finish it at school. He realised
that nicotine could be absorbed through the skin and that gave him a bright idea. He realised that he could make nicotine patches, 
and sell them
to smoking addicts. The nicotine would be absorbed through the skin, and their nicotine cravings would be gone. The idea was that they would
start with a patch that matched the amount in a cigarette, and then move to smaller patches until they could stop altogether.

This idea, which formed by accident, no doubt saved many lives and improved others.

<p> DNA fingerprinting is the science of analysing a DNA sample, and comparing it to other samples, to find matches. Because every person's 
    DNA is different,
