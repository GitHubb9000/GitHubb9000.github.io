<h2> A.I</h2>

<p> The 2010s saw some major advancements in the A.I space. A.Is could now
    intellingently detect human faces and identify who was in the photo using 
    just a small collection of samples images, which didn't have to be  
    professional photos and could just be photos taken on a phone
    taken by anyone. During this time, OpenAI, the company who is
    well known for creating ChatGPT, also created GPT - 1 ,
    the ancestor to GPT- 3, which ChatGPT runs on. This led
    to A.Is which could now talk naturally, just like a human.
