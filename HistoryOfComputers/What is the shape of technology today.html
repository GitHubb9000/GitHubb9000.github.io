<h1> What is the shape of technology today?</h1>

<h2> Space technology today:</h2>

<h3> Catapulting satellites into space:</h3>

<p> In 2022, 180 satellites were launched into space, and that number will only increase with 
    companies like Starlink, HughesNet, and Viasat creating satellite megaconstellations, and scientifical 
    research orbiters and satellites being launched almost every month.  </p>

<h3> Space Mining:</h3>

<p> The dream of mining asteroids is now changing from sci-fi to reality, thanks to companies like iSpace. 
    Several private companies are now working towards, and are now very close to mining asteroids and other 
    space objects for valuable elements like gold, platinum, and iron.  There still hasn’t been a mission yet, 
    however companies have already acquired their licence, and are very close to launching a mining operation.

<h2> Engineering</h2>

<h3> 3D Printing Houses:</h3>

<p> The latest trend in engineering appears to be 3D printing houses. This new technology
     has now been used all over the world from poverty-struck villages to extravagant cities. T
     his method reduces wastage, is cheaper, and is much quicker to build. Not to mention the fact 
     that these building can withstand floods, earthquakes and winds, better than traditional wood-and-stone 
     houses due to the fact that they are made of more durable materials like concrete and plastic that doesn’t
      have as many age-related issues like rot and mould. This makes it perfect for poor villages where they are
       regularly subjected to natural disasters.

<h3> Solar Roof Tiles:</h3>

<p> Thanks to companies like Tesla, houses can now have roofs that also double up as solar panels.
     They look just like regular roof tiles but they cover the entire roof and provide enough energy
      to power the entire house. This is an excellent way to produce renewable and clean energy.

<h2> Medical Technology:</h2>

<h3> 3D Printed and Artificial body parts:</h3>

<p> Advancements in 3D printing technology have made 3D printing organs a reality. 
    When a patient needs an organ or any other body part, like a joint, the 3D printer
     can custom print a body part that specifically fits the patient. These 3D printers can 
     print out body parts with millimetre precision. This technology is breaking the 
     barriers of medical technology as we know it today.

<h3> Robotic Surgery:</h3>

<p> The use of robots for surgical purposes may sound futuristic,
     but it very much is the preferred solution for invasive surgeries
      nowadays. Surgery is all about the accuracy, skill, precision, 
      and control. For all these reasons, a surgical robot is better than 
      a human surgeon. The human surgeon still has relevance, though. Surgical 
      robots are being incorporated with Augmented Reality so surgeons can get 
      real-time views of what they are doing. This also has other benefits too.
      Surgeons can also carry out practice runs before they complete the actual
        surgery. There are worries that these machines will take over human jobs
         but this is unlikely as robots still need to be controlled by humans. 
         If this technology takes off, this could revolutionize surgery as we know it,
          allowing surgeons to reach a level of precision and accuracy that has been
           previously unattainable with manual surgery.</p>

<h2> Transport:</h2>

<h3> Hyperloop</h3>

<p>One of the most ambitious technologies is Hyperloop. The Hyperloop is a technology
     that involves a vehicle that is shot at ultra-high speeds and can be used as a way 
     to travel long distances quickly. This technology involves a pneumatic 
     ( operated by a gas under pressure) tube using linear induction motors and compressors
      to propel the vehicle at superfast speeds. If successful, passengers could travel at
       speeds around 20% faster than the top speed of most commercial aircraft. However,
        current Hyperloop models are only being used for transporting cargo and only reach 
        speeds of 386 km/h. </p>

        <h3> Semi-autonomous cars:</h3>

        <p> The prospect of fully-driverless cars has been dreamt about since the 1950s,
             when General Motors imagined self-driving cars by 1970. Fast-forward to 2023, 
             there has been some progress, but we still haven’t reached a level of completely
              autonomous driving. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined 6 levels 
              of autonomous driving vehicles. It starts at Level  0, where most classic cars can 
              be placed into. Level 5, which may be achieved someday in the future, would mean
               fully driverless cars which do not need any human help. Currently, we are at stage 
               2  to , which means that cars can control, steering, acceleration, and braking, but still requires the driver to stay fully engaged and take control at any time. Today, Stage 3 and 4 exist in specific systems which are not commercially available yet. Stage 5 today is limited to prototypes that cannot be tested on roads. Stage 5 fully autonomous cars are expected to be commerically available by 2040, or maybe even 2050, to be more realistic.</p>
