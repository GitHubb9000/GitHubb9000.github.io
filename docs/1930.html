<h1> The 1930s</h1>

<h3>  The 1930s saw the world suffering from The Great Depression, which was the result of a major
stock market crash and left many people starving, homeless and in extreme poverty. Therefore, this 
decade's focus was mostly on getting people to survive and less on the latest and greatest.

That doesn't mean that this decade had no exciting innovations, though. This decade still had some pretty 
exciting innovations. Some of these innovations include:</h3>

<h2> The First Colour-Sound Cartoon</h2>

<p> The first TV cartoon with both colour, and sound was created on the 28th of
    October, 1930.  The cartoon was called "Flip the frog - Fiddlesticks" and was created 
by a man called "Ub Iwerks" and was about a happy-go-lucky, needy frog named Flip.

He never really took off and hit the public's hearts' like "Mickey Mouse" or "Popeye" did. However,
he does still hold the record as the first cartoon to feature both colour and sound.</p>

<h2> FM Broadcasting</h2>
<p> FM broadcasting is a method of radio broadcasting that uses and is short for
    " Frequency Modulation". 
    FM broadcasting was invented in 1933 by American Engineer Edwin Armstrong. FM broadcasting offered 
    several advantages over older forms of radio broadcasting such as AM.
    <br>
    Some of these advantages include
    higher fidelity, which means that the audio that reaches the user is more a more 
    accurate representation of the original sound.
    <br>
    FM broadcasting also came with the advantage that the signal could not be also easily blocked 
    or interfered. This meant that there was less static popping. 
    <br>
    FM broadcasting is still widely used in cars and homes today, but modern cars 
    and radios are now starting to adapt to the new DAB radio technology, which is another 
upgrade over the FM standard.</p>

<h2> The Jet Engine </h2>
<p> The first jet engine was created in the 1930s by Sir Frank Whittle/ Hans von Ohain.
    A jet engine is defined as " an engine using jet propulsion for forward thrust,
     mainly used for aircraft."
Both Sir Frank Whittle, a Royal Air Force officer ( although he invented it independently from the 
air force)
as well as German physicist Hans von Ohain are both credited for inventing the jet engine. 
The story behind this is that they both 
independently created versions of the jet engine in the late 1930s. However, while 
Ohain's jet was the first to fly, nobody knew about it due to military secrecy under the Nazi regime.
Sir Frank Whittle's engine was the first to be patented and publicly recorded, so his was officially
the first aircraft with a jet engine.
<br>
This was a major 
achievement in the aerospace industry as it improved both speed, and dependability over 
traditional propellor aircraft.
