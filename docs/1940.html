<h1> The 1940s</h1>

<h3> The 1940s was a time of exciting innovations and discoveries.  The great depression had ended 
    in 1939, leaving people a fresh decade to work on. Here are a inventions that 
were invented in the 1940s.</h3>

<h2> The creation of the microwave oven</h2>

<p> The microwave oven is no doubt one of the most useful gadgets in our kitchen. It is safe, fast, and 
    convenient to heat up almost any food. But it's creation was most certainly a 
    very interesting one.
</p>

<p> Percy Spencer, an american engineer working at Raytheon stood in front of his 
    magnetron ( a device that creates or amplifies microwaves, initially used for radars)
    with a candy bar in his pocket. After a while, he realizes that the candy bar has melted.
    He then has a hunch that the microwaves from the magnetron are what caused the candy bar to 
    melt. He then tests his hunch by placing a plate of unpopped corn in front of the magnetron.
    After a while, it pops! Eureka!
</p>

<p> When the microwaves hit water molecules inside a piece of food, the water molecules are
    agitated and start moving around. They starting bumping into each other, causing friction,
    and therefore, heat. Furthermore, because plate and other container do not contain
    water molecules, microwaves do not run the risk of heating up containers
    and causing damage.
</p>


<p> It took until the 1950s for the first commercial microwave oven came out, but there is no denying
    that this is truly one of the most useful innovations of all time.

<h2> The creation of the nuclear bomb </h2>
<p> Most people know about nuclear bombs and the devastation that they leave. However, many people argue
    that the scientific knowledge they have brought us are crucial to mankind. Obviously, the creation
    of the nuclear bomb has been a very controversial one. Even the creator of the Manhattan Project
    ( The project that developed the nuclear bombs used in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki) 
    was shaken by the destructive power of what we had created and opposed to the use of 
    the bombs on Japan, even sending a letter to the president of the US. The president never
    received the letter.
</p>




     <p> It all started when German scientists Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassman discovered
        something called nuclear fission. 
        They realized they could split an atom of radioactive material into lighter atoms, 
        resulting in a  sudden, powerful release of energy.
    
    The US then heard about this. Physicist Leo Szilard and other scientists then decided to warn 
the US government about the massive power of nuclear weapons and the threat that they impose.
Without a response from the government, they decided to ask for the help of Albert Einstien, a well known
scientist. Einstein was a devoted pacifist and was reluctant about contacting the government about creating 
a weapon that could theoretically kill millions of people.
He then later changed his mind because of concerns that Nazi Germany would develop the weapon first.
<br>
<br>
By 1945, the first nuclear bomb was created. On July 16, 1945, the first test, called the " Trinity
Test" was conducted in a location in the New Mexico desert known as
 Jornada del Muerto, Spanish for "Journey of the Dead Man." 
<br>
<br>
At 5:30 a.m., the bomb went off. There a forceful flash, a wave of heat, a huge shock wave, and a 
mushroom cloud extending 40,00 feet. The launch tower was completely disintegrated, and the surrounding
desert was covered in jade-green radioactive glass. The bomb was successful. 
<br>
<br>
On August 6, 1945, a B-29 U.S Bomber dropped " Little Boy" on top of the Japanese city of Hiroshima.
The resulting explosion killed around 140,000. Japan still refuses to surrender. 

3 Days later, another bomb is dropped, this time on the city of Nagasaki. Around 130,000 dead.
 The invention of the nuclear bomb has been one of the most complicated, but also deadliest creation of all time.
