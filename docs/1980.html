<h1> The 1980s </h1>

<h3> The 1980s saw some interesting development in technology,
particularly in the medical technology department.</h3>

<h2> The invention of the nicotine patch </h2>

<p> The nicotine patch was invented by scientist Frank Etscorn in the 1980s. He grew up surrounded by tobbaco, and his wife was a heavy
    smoker. He himself was not a smoker, but he was aware of the health impacts nicotine had, and was frustated by his wife's chain
smoking habit.  Inside the tobacco, it is the nicotine that addicts people. The other things mixed in, 
like the carbon monoxide and the tar are what harms the body. The tar, which is the greasy, brown stuff at the end of a filter, 
causes the cancer. Meanwhile, the carbon monoxide blocks the heart's ability to gather oxygen, causig lung problems.
<br>
One day, he was working in his lab, researching about nausea, when he accidentally split a very large dose of liquid nicotine on
himself. Within minutes, he was very sick. He realised
that nicotine could be absorbed through the skin and that gave him a bright idea. He realised that he could make nicotine patches, 
and sell them
to smoking addicts. The nicotine would be absorbed through the skin, and their nicotine cravings would be gone, without the tar or 
carbon monoxide.. The idea was that they would
start with a patch that matched the amount in a cigarette, and then move to smaller patches until they could stop altogether.   
<br>
<br>
This idea, which formed by accident, no doubt saved many lives and improved others. 

<h2> The discovery of DNA fingerprinting
</h2>

<p> DNA fingerprinting is the science of analysing a DNA sample, and comparing it to other samples, to find matches. Because every person's 
    DNA is unique, just like a fingerprint, you can take a DNA sample from a person and use it to 
    identify them. In 1983, scientist Alec Jefferys reads in a local newspaper about a local murder. He is 
    horrified, but knows that he cannot do anything to help. One day, while he was conducting
    experiments in his lab, he realises that even though people with blood relation, such as parents and 
    children, and siblings, every person's DNA is unique. 
    <br>
    <br>
    By this time, it had been 3 years since the murder. However, they find a second body, and someone has
    confessed to this second crime, but not the second one, After lots of analysis, he discovers that 
    both the crimes are from the same murderer, but neither of them are from the person that confessed
    to the second murder. The police order a blood test of all the men in the town. There was one problem.
    None of the samples matched the DNA found on the murder scene. Jefferys, frustated by this, realises
    that someone must have found a loophole in his technique. Eventually, they realise that the murderer
    convinced a friend to give a blood sample for him. They eventually find the murderer and arrest him.
    <br>
    <br>
    A murder successfully solved using technology. This technology put many guilty criminals behind bars while also freeing many other
    innocent people. A few of the falsely convincted criminals were also in Death Row, so their lives' were saved.
