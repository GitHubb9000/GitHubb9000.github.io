<h1> 2020 until today</h1>

<p> We are still in the 2020s, so it is impossible to summarize this decade. However, here are a few technological advancements that have happened
    so far. 
</p>

<h2> Hydrogen</h2>
<p> We know of a fact hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, making up about 3 quarters of all matter. 
What's really interesting? We are now learning to burn hydrogen in order to make fuel for cars, manufacturing, and other 
things that need power to run. Unlike petrol, when hydrogen burns, it does not pollute. The only by-product of burning hydrogen is water.
Unlike using a battery, hydrogen is stored in a liquid form, meaning there are no recharge times.
<br>
<br>
Hydrogen is quickly becoming a new technology that could take over the world one day.

<h2> Virutal test subjects</h2>

<p> Doctors are now experimenting with swapping out human test subjects for medicine and treatments with virtual
    test subjects. High resolution images of a human organs along with complex mathematical 
    models of the mechanisms that control that organ's function are fed into a machine and a supercomputer can run simulations
    of the organ responding and reacting to various treatments and medicine. 
<br>
<br>
This may completely revolutionise the way we test and invent new treatments, as this will be significantly safer and faster than using actual human
test subjects.</p>
